Data-Structures
===============

A compilation of all the code that I'll be covering in my 4th Semester Course of Data Structures.

Some code maybe incomplete or faulty/buggy. Please feel free to report
them as issues in this repo. 

Else please notify me at <harishnavnit@gmail.com>


Running the Code
================

1. Clone the repo
2. Go the directory containing the "main.cpp" file
3. Simply run "g++ main.cpp"
4. To obtain an executable with a different name use the option "-o"
   with g++
5. Run the executable generated

Thanks!
